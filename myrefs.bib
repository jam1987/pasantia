Now, place still smaller equilateral triangles in the center of each of the star's 12 sides.

This is an example of the kind of mathematical puzzles that this book addresses.<p> <I>The Fractal Geometry of Nature</I> is a mathematics text. But buried in the deltas and lambdas and integrals, even a layperson can pick out and appreciate Mandelbrot's point: that somewhere in mathematics, there is an explanation for nature.
